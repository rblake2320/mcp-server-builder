üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
One of the supported IDEs:
Cursor
Windsurf
VSCode (with Cline extension)
Installation
Generate API Key

Visit 21st.dev Magic Console
Generate a new API key
Choose Installation Method

Method 1: CLI Installation (Recommended)
One command to install and configure MCP for your IDE:

npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install <client> --api-key <key>
Supported clients: cursor, windsurf, cline, claude

Method 2: Manual Configuration
If you prefer manual setup, add this to your IDE's MCP config file:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@21st-dev/magic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic@latest", "API_KEY=\"your-api-key\""]
    }
  }
}
Config file locations:

Cursor: ~/.cursor/mcp.json
Windsurf: ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
Cline: ~/.cline/mcp_config.json
Claude: ~/.claude/mcp_config.json
Method 3: VS Code Installation
For one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below:

Install with NPX in VS CodeInstall with NPX in VS Code Insiders

Manual VS Code Setup
First, check the install buttons above for one-click installation. For manual setup:

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON):

{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "apiKey",
        "description": "21st.dev Magic API Key",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "@21st-dev/magic": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic@latest"],
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "${input:apiKey}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Optionally, you can add it to a file called .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace:

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "apiKey",
      "description": "21st.dev Magic API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "@21st-dev/magic": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic@latest"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${input:apiKey}"
      }
    }
  }
}
‚ùì FAQ
How does Magic AI Agent handle my codebase?
Magic AI Agent only writes or modifies files related to the components it generates. It follows your project's code style and structure, and integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase without affecting other parts of your application.

Can I customize the generated components?
Yes! All generated components are fully editable and come with well-structured code. You can modify the styling, functionality, and behavior just like any other React component in your codebase.

What happens if I run out of generations?
If you exceed your monthly generation limit, you'll be prompted to upgrade your plan. You can upgrade at any time to continue generating components. Your existing components will remain fully functional.

How soon do new components get added to 21st.dev's library?
Authors can publish components to 21st.dev at any time, and Magic Agent will have immediate access to them. This means you'll always have access to the latest components and design patterns from the community.

Is there a limit to component complexity?
Magic AI Agent can handle components of varying complexity, from simple buttons to complex interactive forms. However, for best results, we recommend breaking down very complex UIs into smaller, manageable components.
