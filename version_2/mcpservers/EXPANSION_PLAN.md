# MCP Servers Collection Expansion Plan

## Goal
Create the most comprehensive collection of MCP servers available, incorporating servers from Smithery.ai and Context7, while ensuring our servers have unique functionality and avoid direct copying.

## Categories to Expand

Based on the Smithery.ai categories, we should organize our servers into these main categories:

1. **Web Search & Browsing**
   - Search engines integration (Brave, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Perplexity, Tavily)
   - Web scraping and content extraction
   - Browser automation

2. **Memory Management**
   - Knowledge graph storage
   - Memory banks for session persistence
   - Conversational memory systems

3. **Development Tools**
   - Desktop/system command execution
   - Code generation and analysis
   - Repository management (GitHub, GitLab)

4. **API Integration**
   - Database integrations (MongoDB, Supabase, Neon, etc.)
   - Cloud service providers
   - SaaS product APIs

5. **Thinking & Reasoning**
   - Sequential thinking tools
   - Decision-making frameworks
   - Structured problem-solving

6. **Data Processing**
   - Document handling
   - Media processing
   - Data analysis and visualization

7. **Utilities**
   - Toolbox/router servers
   - Authentication helpers
   - Environmental sensors

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (In Progress)
- ✅ Create base templates for JavaScript and Python
- ✅ Add browser functionality for list view and A-Z filtering
- ✅ LLM Integration template
- ✅ Database integration examples

### Phase 2: Priority Servers
- Add web search servers (Brave, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Tavily alternatives)
- Add memory management systems
- Add desktop command and GitHub integration

### Phase 3: Category Expansion
- Fill out remaining categories with at least 3 servers each
- Ensure full coverage of all major functionality

### Phase 4: Documentation and Discovery
- Create showcases for each server
- Add detailed setup instructions
- Create comparison guides

## Server Requirements
Each server in our collection should:

1. Follow MCP protocol specification
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Have clear setup instructions
4. Demonstrate best practices
5. Be fully functional without direct API key dependencies where possible

## Implementation Notes

- Use placeholder API endpoints to demonstrate functionality
- Include environment variable setup guides
- Create server alternatives that don't require paid API keys
- Differentiate our implementation with improved features where possible

## Tracking Progress

We'll maintain a table in this document with information about each server:

| Category | Name | Description | Status | Priority |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Web Search | Brave Search | Alternative to Smithery's Brave integration | Planned | High |
| Web Search | Multi-Search | Searches across multiple engines | Planned | Medium |
| Memory | Knowledge Graph | Graph-based memory store | Planned | High |
| Memory | Vector Memory | Vector embedding storage | Planned | Medium |
