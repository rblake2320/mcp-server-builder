Based on the `package.json` you provided and our previous discussions about building an MCP Server Builder with features like URL import, automatic dependency installation, Docker integration, and Google AI Studio integration, here's an analysis of your dependencies:

**Missing Core Packages for Planned Features:**

1.  **`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`:** This is the **essential** package for building MCP-compliant servers in Node.js/TypeScript. Your current dependencies don't include it. You'll need this to define MCP tools, parameters, and handle the protocol communication.
    ```bash
    npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
    ```

2.  **`@google/generative-ai`:** To integrate Google AI Studio (Gemini API) for the features we discussed (AI assistance, code generation/review, etc.), you need the official Google AI SDK for Node.js.
    ```bash
    npm install @google/generative-ai
    ```

**Packages Already Present Supporting Discussed Features:**

*   **`fs-extra`**: Useful for advanced file system operations needed for packaging/deployment steps (already present, correctly identified from the previous `fs.copySync` error discussion).
*   **`archiver` / `extract-zip`**: Necessary for creating/extracting the server package ZIP files (already present).
*   **`simple-git` / `degit`**: Support the "Import from URL" feature by allowing repository cloning/downloading (already present).
*   **`zod`**: Excellent for defining schemas and validating MCP tool parameters (already present).
*   **`express`**: Suitable for potentially serving an MCP server over HTTP or for the builder's own API backend (already present).
*   **`ws`**: Useful if you plan any real-time communication features within the builder itself (already present).

**Potential Redundancies or Considerations:**

*   **Session Stores (`memorystore` vs. `connect-pg-simple`):** You have both `memorystore` (in-memory) and `connect-pg-simple` (PostgreSQL-backed via NeonDB) listed. Typically, you'd choose one for `express-session`. For production or persistent sessions, `connect-pg-simple` with your NeonDB setup is appropriate. `memorystore` might be useful for development but could be removed if `connect-pg-simple` covers all needs.
*   **UI Components (`@radix-ui/*` etc.):** You have a very comprehensive set of UI components, likely from using Shadcn/ui. This is great for building the frontend UI of the MCP Server Builder.
*   **Build Tools (`vite`, `esbuild`, `tsx`):** This combination is modern and efficient for building a React frontend and a TypeScript backend.

**Conclusion:**

Your current `package.json` provides a strong foundation for a full-stack application with a sophisticated frontend, backend API, database integration, and authentication. However, **to specifically implement the core MCP Server Builder functionality and the planned Google AI integration, you critically need to add `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `@google/generative-ai`.**

You do not appear to need fundamentally *different* packages for most other features discussed (like URL import or packaging), as you already have suitable libraries like `fs-extra`, `simple-git`, `archiver`, etc.
