## **How to Set It Up**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Docker Installed**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**:
  - Go to your GitHub account settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens.
  - Generate a token with the necessary permissions (e.g., `repo` for private repositories).

### **Steps**
1. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN= ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
   ```
   Replace `` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.

2. **Configure Claude Desktop or Other Clients**:
   Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (or similar configuration file for other clients):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "github": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "-i",
           "--rm",
           "-e",
           "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=",
           "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart the Client**:
   Restart Claude Desktop or any other client you are using to load the new configuration.
