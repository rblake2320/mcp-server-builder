## Local Deployment

The simplest way to run your MCP server is locally on your own computer.

### Python Server

1. Extract your downloaded server package
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the extracted folder
4. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mcp-client-sdk
   ```
6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### TypeScript/Node.js Server

1. Extract your downloaded server package
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the extracted folder
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

**Note**: When running locally, your server will only be available while your computer is on and the terminal window is open.

## Replit Deployment

Replit is a browser-based development platform that makes it easy to deploy and host applications without managing servers.

### For Python Server

1. Create a free account at [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Click "Create Repl"
3. Choose "Python" as your template
4. Name your Repl (e.g., "my-mcp-server")
5. Click "Create Repl"
6. In the Files panel, upload your `server.py` file
7. Create a new file called `requirements.txt` with the following content:
   ```
   mcp-client-sdk
   ```
8. Click the "Run" button

### For TypeScript/Node.js Server

1. Create a free account at [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Click "Create Repl"
3. Choose "Node.js" as your template
4. Name your Repl (e.g., "my-mcp-server")
5. Click "Create Repl"
6. In the Files panel, upload your `server.js` file and `package.json`
7. Click the "Run" button

Replit will keep your server running even after you close the browser tab. To connect to it from Claude Desktop:

1. In Claude Desktop, add a new MCP server with:
   - Type: "stdio"
   - Command: Reference to your Replit URL

## Lovable Deployment

Lovable is a platform designed for easy application deployment.

1. Create an account at [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) or similar platform
2. Create a new project
3. Choose the appropriate project type (Python or Node.js)
4. Upload your server files
5. Configure the deployment settings:
   - For Python: Set the start command to `python server.py`
   - For Node.js: The platform should automatically detect the start command from package.json
6. Deploy your application

## Firebase Deployment

Firebase works well for deploying Node.js MCP servers.

### For TypeScript/Node.js Server

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```
2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```
3. Initialize Firebase in your project folder:
   ```bash
   firebase init functions
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Choose JavaScript
   - Say yes to ESLint
   - Say yes to installing dependencies
4. Modify `functions/index.js` to include your server code
5. Deploy to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

## Docker Deployment

Your MCP server package includes a Dockerfile for easy containerization.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you haven't already
2. Navigate to your server folder in the terminal
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-mcp-server .
   ```
4. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-mcp-server
   ```

Docker containers can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:
- [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
- [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-instances/)
- [DigitalOcean Container Registry](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry/)

## Cloud Platform Deployments

### Heroku

1. Create a free account at [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
2. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Login to Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
4. Navigate to your server folder
5. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
6. Create a Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create my-mcp-server
   ```
7. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

### Render

Render is a unified platform to build and run all your apps, websites, and services.

1. Create an account at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "New" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository or use the manual deploy option
4. Configure your service:
   - Name: my-mcp-server
   - Runtime: Node.js or Python
   - Build Command: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `node server.js` or `python server.py`
5. Click "Create Web Service"

### DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create an account at [digitalocean.com](https://digitalocean.com)
2. Navigate to the App Platform section
3. Click "Create App"
4. Connect your GitHub repository or upload your files directly
5. Configure your app:
   - Type: Web Service
   - Environment: Node.js or Python
   - Build Command: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run Command: `node server.js` or `python server.py`
6. Choose your plan (Starter plans are available for simple applications)
7. Click "Launch App"

### AWS Lambda

For event-driven MCP servers that don't need to run continuously:

1. Create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to the Lambda console
3. Click "Create function"
4. Choose "Author from scratch"
5. Configure your function:
   - Name: my-mcp-server
   - Runtime: Node.js or Python
6. Upload your code as a ZIP file
7. Set the handler to point to your main function
8. Configure environment variables if needed
9. Click "Create function"

## Keeping Your Server Online

For your MCP server to be useful, it needs to stay online. Here are some options:

1. **Free Tier Cloud Services**: Platforms like Render, Heroku, and Replit offer free tiers that can keep your service running.

2. **Paid Hosting**: For more reliable performance, consider a paid plan on any of the platforms mentioned. Prices typically start at $5-10 per month.

3. **Always-On Local Device**: You can run your server on a Raspberry Pi or old computer that stays on 24/7.

4. **Scheduled Restarts**: Some free services put applications to sleep after periods of inactivity. Set up a service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping your application regularly and keep it awake.

## Connecting Your Deployed Server to Claude Desktop

Once your server is deployed, you'll need to connect it to Claude Desktop:

1. In Claude Desktop settings, add a new MCP server
2. For the server type:
   - If your server is running locally: Use "command" type with the appropriate command
   - If your server is deployed to the web: Use "sse" type with the URL of your server

## Conclusion

Your MCP server is now deployed and ready to use! You can now extend Claude's capabilities with custom tools and integrations.

Remember that the base server generated by the MCP Server Builder provides the structure, but you'll need to implement the actual functionality for each tool. This might require some programming knowledge or help from a developer.

For more advanced deployments or customizations, consider consulting with a developer or DevOps professional.
