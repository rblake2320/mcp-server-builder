## **Key Features of GitHub MCP Server**

The GitHub MCP Server provides structured tools for interacting with GitHub’s ecosystem. Its primary use cases include:

1. **Automating Workflows**:
   - Automate repository management tasks such as creating repositories, managing branches, and handling pull requests/issues.

2. **Data Extraction and Analysis**:
   - Extract structured data from repositories for analytics or AI-powered applications.

3. **AI-Powered Development Tools**:
   - Enable AI assistants like Claude to interact with GitHub repositories for tasks such as code generation, issue tracking, and pull request management.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Docker**: Required for containerized deployment.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Needed to authenticate with GitHub APIs.
  - Create a token via GitHub’s Developer Settings and enable the necessary permissions (e.g., `repo` for private repositories or `public_repo` for public ones).

### **2. Installation Options**

#### **a) Docker Deployment**
This is the recommended method due to its simplicity and isolation benefits.

1. Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (for Claude Desktop):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "github": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "-i",
           "--rm",
           "-e",
           "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=",
           "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
         ],
         "env": {
           "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": ""
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Replace `` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.
3. Restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

#### **b) Build from Source**
If Docker is unavailable, you can build the server using Go:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server.git
   cd github-mcp-server
   ```
2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/github-mcp-server
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./github-mcp-server stdio
   ```
4. Ensure the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set.

### **3. VS Code Integration**
For users who prefer Visual Studio Code:

1. Open User Settings (JSON) in VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + P` → `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`).
2. Add the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "inputs": [
         {
           "type": "promptString",
           "id": "github_token",
           "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
           "password": true
         }
       ],
       "servers": {
         "github": {
           "command": "docker",
           "args": [
             "run",
             "-i",
             "--rm",
             "-e",
             "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=${input:github_token}",
             "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
           ],
           "env": {
             "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

---

### **4. Customization**
You can override tool descriptions or add custom translations by creating a `github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary:
```json
{
  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "Add a comment to an issue.",
  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a repository."
}
```

Alternatively, use environment variables to override descriptions:
```bash
export GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="Add a comment to an issue."
```
